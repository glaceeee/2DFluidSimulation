# 2DFluidSimulation
credit to Jos Stam this is the article i used: http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/nsp/course/15-464/Fall09/papers/StamFluidforGames.pdf. i spent weeks understanding his code and all the mathematical concepts and i understand every line of code here but its not my code (although i did write it myself).
Sorry this ones a bit messy visual studio was being weird about pushing this to github but yeah.
Again this is Jos Stam's code. I merely spent hours researching everything and understanding everything before i wrote a single line of code, but at the end of the day its his implementation.
I was going to add a lot more to this but i got bored and couldnt find the motivation to continue.
If you want to add anything you can just read the long ass comment i left right above the main function in Solver.cpp (there is only one .cpp file anyways).

itll take quite some time before i return to c or c++ but i cant wait cause as nice as java is i do miss my pointers and references a lot
